# HideSIMicon
Hide SIM 1 icon in the O+ 3T, but easily to change it for the SIM 2

This is useful if you have a SIM 1 in your phone, but you only use it when you go to a certain country, the rest of the time is disabled. Since that disabled icon might get a bit annoying, this module lets you hide it.

Built initially from the module of vemacs (https://github.com/vemacs/HideVoLTEIcon), just changed the hook to address our needs.
